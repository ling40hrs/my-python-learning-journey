# My Python Learning Journey: Beginner Mini-Projects

## üåü About This Repository

Welcome! This repository is a collection of small Python projects and exercises I'm building as I learn Python. Each project typically corresponds to a concept or chapter I've just finished in a Python programming book (RN Automate the Boring Stuff with Python).

My goal is to immediately apply what I learn to solidify my understanding and build practical skills. Think of this as my public notebook where I experiment and grow!

## üöÄ How to Run These Projects

Each mini-project is designed to be self-contained within its own folder.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ling40hrs/my-python-learning-journey.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a project folder:**
    ```bash
    cd my-python-learning-journey/1-Story-with-login
    # Or cd into any other project folder you want to run
    ```
3.  **Run the Python script:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    # Or whatever the main script file is named within that folder
    ```

## ‚ú® What's Next?

I plan to continue adding new projects as I advance through my Python learning resources. My focus will be on:

*   Applying new syntax and concepts.
*   Building small, functional applications.
*   Improving my code structure and readability.
*   Learning best practices for version control with Git and GitHub.
